#Generating Poetic Texts with Recurrent Neural Networks

This project generates text in the style of William Shakespeare using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. 
The model is trained on a subset of Shakespeare's works. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and text generation. 
The text data is loaded, converted to lowercase, and a subset is used for training. 
Characters are mapped to indices and vice versa for one-hot encoding. An LSTM model is defined, compiled, and trained on the dataset. 
After training, the model generates new text sequences based on the learned patterns from the Shakespearean text.
